# Git LFS Scripts - Go Migration Complete

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All bash scripts have been successfully converted to Go.

## Implementation Summary

### Architecture
- **Approach:** Independent binaries (Option A)
- Each command is a standalone Go binary
- Shared code organized in `internal/` packages
- All commands use `git-` prefix and work as Git subcommands

### Commands Created (10 total)
1. `git-ls-files` - Frontend for `git ls-files` with pattern permutation
2. `git-lfs-files` - Frontend for `git lfs ls-files` with pattern permutation
3. `git-lfs-track` - Frontend for `git lfs track` with pattern permutation
4. `git-lfs-untrack` - Frontend for `git lfs untrack` with pattern permutation
5. `git-lfs-trace` - Transfer adapter (converted from Ruby to Go)
6. `git-nonlfs` - List files not in Git LFS
7. `git-unmigrate` - Reverse `git lfs migrate import`
8. `git-new-bare-repo` - Create bare Git repositories
9. `git-delete-github-repo` - Delete GitHub repositories (requires `gh` CLI)
10. `git-giftless` - Go wrapper for Python Giftless LFS server

### Key Decisions Made
1. ✅ Multiple git subcommands in one project - No issues
2. ✅ Use `git-` prefix throughout
3. ✅ Separate binaries sharing code (Option B) for ls-files family
4. ✅ Standard Go installation directories
5. ✅ Go wrapper for Python giftless (WSGI compatibility)

### Building and Installation
```bash
# Build all commands
make build

# Install to ~/.local/bin (default)
make install

# Or install to custom location
make install INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin
```

### Testing
All commands built successfully and tested:
- Help output verified for all commands
- Pattern expansion working correctly
- Dry-run functionality tested
